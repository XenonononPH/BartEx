# BartEx
‘BartEx’ is a currency converter application and its main purpose is to exchange different currencies across different countries. It allows the user to select their preferred currencies and put in any amount. It saves the input every time a conversion is made and can view and delete at any time. For a faster comparison, the user can swap the selected currencies. The currency rate is based upon the mid-market, and will be displayed as its conversion rates. The sampled currencies work as intended, but as exchange rates differ from time to time, the application needs to be updated frequently to keep up. Only available in Android as it was made in Java within IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio.
